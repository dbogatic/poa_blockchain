# Proof of Authority (PoA) Blockchain 


The goal of this repo is to show steps needed to set up a testnet blockchain for an organization using Geth and to simulate a crypto transaction on the ETH network via MyCrypto application. To do this, we will need to:


* Set up a custom testnet blockchain using [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/)


* Send a test transaction.

* Verify that test transaction was recorded in our blockchain and registered in our [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/account) wallet.

#
### Setting up a Proof of Authority (PoA) blockchain
#
In order to setup our testnet blockchain we will use:

* Puppeth, to name our network and generate the initial genesis block.

* Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes, and connect the nodes together.

* Setup the Clique Proof of Authority consensus algorithm.
